## An exploratory look into whether or not and if yesï¼Œ how much does neighboorhoods affect house prices 

Real Estate pricing is a major investment product and impacts many business investments like the stock market, retail pricing, House Pricing index.  Thus, it makes sense that Real Estate pricing is an important knowledge for businesses to have as it impacts the economy. It is difficult to collect up-to-date data housing data due to its fluidity. What if the neighborhood make up of a city can offer a good estimation of its Housing prices. And if so, can we model the relationship between neighborhoods and housing prices.

## In this Notebook, we take a look at how different types of neighboods impact housing prices 

I will be using venue data from the Foursquare API to cluster neighborhoods in the different cities and adding a label accordingly. I will be using the house pricing index for data on house pricing in Canada as indexes. The data is only available for Canada as it was difficult to find similar data for the US.

### We will be taking a look at major cities in Canada and US and seeing the make up of neighborhoods in these cities
